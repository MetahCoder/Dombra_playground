# Dombra_playground
My submission for the Swift Student Challenge 2020. 

I decided to combine two things I am passionate about coding and playing dombra. Dombra is a Kazakh national instrument that consists of two strings. In my playground, the main feature is a provided opportunity for users to play on the instrument as if it is real.  

The applcation was created by Askar Almukhametov.
